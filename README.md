##Story##
DayZ Epidemic takes place after the first few weeks of the apacolypse. It is during this time the government has moved in and is trying 
to get rid of the infected and will not let anyone get in their way. Any survivor's in this hot zone are to be eliminated by brute
force for risk of the infection spreading.

The government has issued hazmat units to bomb and then infiltrate various cities riding them of the infection. The attempts to contain
the infection are starting to be proven worthless and the infection is spreading faster and faster across the land.
&nbsp;

##Backstory##
You are a civilian who has had quite the rough time. During the intitial zombie outbreak your family was eaten and dismembered while you
was away at your job. You came home to discover their bodies lying in and around the closet where they had attempted to hide from what
looked like a home invasion. As you went to hold your family tight and mourne your loss one of them was beginning to move and as you
approached them, they turned looking you in the eyes. A dead stare from dead eyes, they began moaning and getting up. You became
terrified as you had seen that stare so many times before on various zombie movies you had watched in the past. You knew right away that
you needed to get out of there. You left your house and closed the door behind as you walked out onto the porch. You will never forget
the sounds coming from the house as your family attempted to pound through the door.

Your first thought's were to get far away from the area as you can. Heading for the only place you knew, you pulled your head together
and got a move on towards the Air Field. Many other survivors were standing in a line to board one of the C130J's that was currently
shuttling people out of the area.

After a few hours of waiting and many distant gunshots, it was finaly your turn to board the plane. You stepped onboard with an uneasy
feeling. Quickly finding a seat as the last survivors boarded the plane, you hear the engines start up and the doors close. You sit back
in your seat to relax just a little as the plane takes off and is beginning to make a turn towards Chernarus far away from the infection.
Suddenly a passenger stands up and starts making weird twitchy motions and you cannot hear anything over the screams coming from the few
passangers near there. A few passangers were already being eaten and starting to turn as you push and shove your way towards the emergency
exit. Thinking it's better to take your chances on the ground rather then trapped with a bunch of infected passangers on a plane you grab
the emergency parachute strapped to the wall next to the emergency door. Pulling the handle you take one look back as hands start to close
around your arm and jump.
